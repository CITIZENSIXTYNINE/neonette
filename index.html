		<h1>Neonette</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>This is Neonette, an incredibly purple, but lightweight-ish stylesheet based on <a href="https://nanom.neocities.org">nanom's style.css</a> (from mid-2021, it kinda changed after a year). Made to be easy to use, modern and nice to look at, Neonette is perfect for making heavy text-based sites or just simple "homepage" sites like <a href="https://obama.solutions/~nicoleaoki">mine</a>!</p>
		<p>If you're interested in using Neonette in your project, check out <a href="https://github.com/nicoleaoki/neonette">the Github repo</a> with instructions on how to use it, although it's as easy as adding one link to your HTML/CSS/JSX.</p>
		<p>Below, a demo of Neonette is shown, showing off most of HTML's tags while using Neonette, made by <a href="https://granneman.com/webdev/coding/htmlcsstestpage">Scott Granneman</a>, It's a bit clunky but shows off most of what Neonette is capable of.</p>
