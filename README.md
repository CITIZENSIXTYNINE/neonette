***PALE AND LACY ARE STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT, TRYING TO LOAD THEM WILL DO NOTHING AS THIS REPOSITORY DOES NOT CONTAIN PALE AND LACY, USE NEON IN THE MEANTIME***

# Neonette

Neonette is a set of **minimal baseline stylesheets** based on [Nanom's Website](https://nanom.neocities.org).

It includes a basic reset and default styling for all HTML5 elements.

You can see Neonette's various colour schemes "in action" on my [website](https://iwearvans.tk)!

## Usage

To use Neonette, just select one of the 3 color schemes that Neonette offers:
- Neon (our flagship scheme, use `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://neonette.netlify.app/neon.css">`)
- Pale (blue-ish green-ish scheme, use `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://neonette.netlify.app/pale.css">`)
- Lacy (a *dark red* scheme, use `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://neonette.netlify.app/lacy.css">`)

You do not need to import fonts or anything, our stylesheet already does that by default with the Terminus font!
